# Wind-Waker-Item-and-Map-Tracker
A Map/Item tracker for the Wind Waker Randomizer. Created by Darkened5ky, updated logic by emerald000, with aesthetics help from Spleebie.

##Usage
- This is a pack for the program "EmoTracker", which can be obtained at https://emotracker.net/. The pack itself can be downloaded directly from within EmoTracker, so there is no need for you to download it from here.

##Map Tracking Help
- Locations that are green mean that every item in that location is within logic.
- Locations that are orange mean some items are obtainable, but not all of them.
- Dungeons will always appear orange at first. Be sure you're marking your keys as the tracker checks for those keys in order to open the   dungeon chests that need them. Once you have all of the keys and necessary items, the dungeons will finally turn green as well.
- Locations that are yellow mean that you can get the item, but it isn't in logic. This is called a sequence break. Usually this means      there is some kind of glitch or tricky tech involved. Check the Randomizer Discord for details on the sequence breaks.
- Locations that are blue mean that you can find out what item is there (via. seeing it or from reading some type of hint) before you can   get it. For these, you can mark which item is there by clicking on the dotted box. Eventually when you mark off this location, the item   will automatically fill into your tracker.

##The Map Itself
- The map is a custom sea chart I made using screenshots from the real game. The reefs are a bit bigger than the other islands for           convenience of telling which is which. The locations are mostly where they are on the actual great sea, but some of them may be a little   bit off. However, all of them should get you to the right area.

##Settings
- Be sure you go to the settings tab and toggle the settings you used for the generation of your rando seed. Otherwise no locations will     show as accessible at all.

##TODO List:
- Create a tab for tracking Treasure/Triforce Charts. This will take some time and may not be done until post-release. (Yes, I do plan on   still doing this potentially.)
- Decide what to do with the Withered Trees Sidequest. Currently it is located at Forest Haven, but I may want to have it show for every     location a withered tree is at. So maybe get coordinates for these?
- Get coordinates for all of the locations the Ghost Ship appears in.
- Get coordinates for all of the locations Cyclos appears in.
- Get coordinates for all of the Salvage Corps. locations. I don't know where all of these are since there are no lists online.
