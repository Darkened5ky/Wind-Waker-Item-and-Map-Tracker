##Usage
- This is a pack for EmoTracker, which can be obtained at https://emotracker.net/.
   The pack itself can be downloaded directly from within EmoTracker, so there is no need for you to download it from GitHub.
   Experimental updates from GitHub are not guaranteed to function fully.

##Map Tracking Help
- Locations that are green mean that every item in that location is within logic.
- Locations that are orange mean some items, but not all, are obtainable.
   Notably, dungeons will be orange until you have all necessary items including keys.
- Locations that are yellow mean that you could get the item, but it isn't in 1.8.0 logic.
   Usually, this means there is a glitch, exploit, or other trick involved.
   Check the Wind Waker Randomizer Discord (#speedrun-strats) for details on the sequence breaks.
   For TWWR, dungeons with branching paths for keys assume you have all keys before exploring any path.
- Locations that are blue mean that you can find out what item is there before you access it.
   For these, you can mark which item is there by clicking on the dotted box.
   When you mark off the location, the item will then automatically be added into your tracker.

##The Map Itself
- In 2.0.1.0 of this map tracker, DualVission created a composite of pre-existing screenshots and sprites in game used for sea charts.
   The center of islands appear in the general location as they do in game, but islands are much larger to make differentiating locations faster.
   Things that appear around islands will be in their location relative to the island.
   More distant objects will be in their location relative to the sector.

##Settings
- Be sure you go to the settings tab and toggle the settings you used for the generation of your rando seed.
   Otherwise no locations will show as accessible at all.

##TODO List:
- Create a tab for tracking Treasure/Triforce Charts. This will take some time and may not be done until post-release. (Yes, I do plan on still doing this potentially.)
- Stylize settings text for broadcaster view (dv)
